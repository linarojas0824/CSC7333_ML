**Data-Driven Predictive Modeling for Chemical Plants: A Comparative Analysis of ML models** <br>
<br>
This project focuses on the application of machine learning (ML) to enhance operations in chemical plants. Employing unsupervised learning techniques such as dimension reduction and
clustering, our goal is to simplify multivariable datasets containing information on operational conditions such as flow, rate, temperature, pressure, and level, while identifying inherent patterns in the data. Following that, supervised learning models for classification and regression will be developed. <br>
<br>
Simulated plant data was used for training and evaluation, with ML tools and libraries, such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Python for model development and analysis. <br>
